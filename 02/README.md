This example demonstrates usage of [d3-component](https://github.com/curran/d3-component) to create a spinner component, and render it conditionally while something is loading. After loading finishes, the spinner goes away and is replaced by another component.

How often have you seen a data visualization show nothing but a blank screen while the data is loading? Showing a spinner with D3 and hiding it after data is loaded is not as easy as it seems. Here's a solution for doing this, feel free to use it in your projects!

This demonstrates the following patterns supported by [d3-component](https://github.com/curran/d3-component):

 * Use of local state and lifecycle hooks (spinner timer).
 * Composition of components with conditional rendering (app component).
